	<p> Hello all and welcome to my webpage, I am currently a student at the University of Georgia and plan to graduate in 2021. Recently I have chosen to be an economics major due to my interest it the concepts of how the economy works. I plan to take this major and get into the field of analyzing the economy and pinpointing financial crimes.<p> <p>Around campus, I am involved in Uga Miracle which is a philanthropy Organization that benefits Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. The organization has many events around campus and is a great way to meet new people. I saw this as a great opportunity to branch out and meet new people and so far it has been a blast There is a link avaliable below in which you can read about the organization and what it has to offer.<p> <p>I am also a diehard New York Yankees Fan. Baseball has always been my passion and ever since I was injured and unable to play again,  I have always had a love for sports but baseball has always been my passion. One of the major attractions of UGA is the impeccable football team. I saw this as a major strongsuit when I was applying to colleges and this played a big factor into where I was going to go to school. <p>
