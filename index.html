	<p> Hello all and welcome to my webpage, I am currently a student at the University of Georgia and plan to graduate in 2021. Recently I have chosen to be an economics major due to my interest it the concepts of how the economy works. I plan to take this major and get into the field of analyzing the economy and pinpointing financial crimes.</p> <p> Around campus, I am involved in Uga Miracle which is a philanthropy Organization that benefits Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. The organization has many events around campus and is a great way to meet new people. I saw this as a great opportunity to branch out and meet new people and so far it has been a blast There is a link avaliable below in which you can read about the organization and what it has to offer.</p> <p> I am also a diehard New York Yankees Fan. Baseball has always been my passion and ever since I was injured and unable to play again. I know that the game of baseball will always be a part of me and for that I am grateful. I am also very dedicated to the UGA football team, I saw the spectacular football team as a major attraction when deciding where to go to school and ultimately the footbal team had a role in the decision I made. </p>
